                        Jack, an engineer, works on a team responsible for
                        building a new digital product. Each day, he meets with
                        his team to share his progress, blockers, and
                        impediments. However, Jack often feels disconnected from
                        the progress of the other five teams working on the same
                        project. The lack of real-time updates leaves him
                        wondering if they encounter similar obstacles. As a
                        result, valuable time and resources are wasted as teams
                        unknowingly duplicate their efforts to overcome shared
                        blockers.

                    Jill, a dedicated product owner, collaborates with Jack's
                    engineering team. She understands the importance of staying
                    informed about the progress of other non-engineering teams,
                    such as design, marketing, operations, HR, and the other
                    engineering teams. However, attending countless meetings to
                    gather updates consumes her time and hinders her ability to
                    focus on quality work and support her team effectively. Jill
                    contemplates sending work progress summary emails, but with
                    six teams involved, it's clear that a more efficient
                    communication method is needed.

                    Supporting both Jack and Jill, Sue, an engineer, attends
                    weekly sync-up events with other engineers. During these
                    meetings, she realizes that similar blockers and impediments
                    plague multiple teams. Independent efforts to find solutions
                    to these recurring challenges result in wasted resources and
                    limit the collective effectiveness of the teams.
                    Additionally, Sue observes a gap between sharing insights
                    and implementing improvements. Despite discussing potential
                    solutions during the sync-ups, it often feels like the
                    shared information isn't fully utilized, and resolutions to
                    blockers are already discovered before they can be addressed
                    as a group.

                        Together, Jack, Jill, and Sue represent the common
                        challenges faced by teams working in silos, lacking
                        real-time updates, and struggling to leverage shared
                        insights effectively. They yearn for a more cohesive and
                        efficient approach to collaboration. Recognizing the
                        need for improved communication, transparency, and
                        knowledge sharing, they seek a solution that can bridge
                        these gaps and facilitate seamless collaboration across
                        the teams involved in the project.
